**TCL (Transaction Control Language)** commands in DBMS are used to manage transactions within a database. A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. TCL commands help ensure that database operations are executed reliably and consistently.

### **Key TCL Commands**

1. **COMMIT**
   - **Purpose**: Saves all changes made during the current transaction permanently to the database.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```sql
     COMMIT;
     ```
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     UPDATE Students SET grade = 'A' WHERE student_id = 1;
     COMMIT;
     ```
   - **Key Points**:
     - Once committed, changes cannot be rolled back.
     - Marks the end of a transaction.

---

2. **ROLLBACK**
   - **Purpose**: Reverts all changes made during the current transaction to the state before the transaction began.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```sql
     ROLLBACK;
     ```
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     UPDATE Students SET grade = 'B' WHERE student_id = 2;
     ROLLBACK;
     ```
   - **Key Points**:
     - Can only undo changes made during the current transaction (since the last `COMMIT`).
     - Restores data to its original state.

3. **SAVEPOINT**
   - **Purpose**: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back without affecting the preceding changes.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```sql
     SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
     ```
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     UPDATE Students SET grade = 'C' WHERE student_id = 3;
     SAVEPOINT sp1;

     UPDATE Students SET grade = 'D' WHERE student_id = 4;

     ROLLBACK TO sp1;
     ```
   - **Key Points**:
     - Useful for partial rollbacks within a transaction.
     - Does not release the transaction; it remains active.

---

4. **SET TRANSACTION**
   - **Purpose**: Configures the properties of a transaction, such as isolation level.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```sql
     SET TRANSACTION [READ WRITE | READ ONLY | ISOLATION LEVEL level];
     ```
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
     ```
   - **Key Points**:
     - Controls how data is accessed or modified during the transaction.
     - Ensures consistency and isolation in multi-user environments.

### **Characteristics of TCL Commands**
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or none at all.
- **Consistency**: Guarantees that the database transitions from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions are executed independently without interference.
- **Durability**: Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even in case of a system failure.

### **Transaction Life Cycle**

1. **Start**: Begin a transaction with operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.
2. **Save**: Use `SAVEPOINT` to set intermediate points in a transaction.
3. **Commit**: Use `COMMIT` to make all changes permanent.
4. **Rollback**: Use `ROLLBACK` to undo changes (entire transaction or up to a `SAVEPOINT`).

### **Examples**

#### **Using COMMIT**
```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, grade) VALUES (1, 'John', 'A');
UPDATE Students SET grade = 'B' WHERE student_id = 1;

COMMIT;
```
- All changes are saved permanently.

---

#### **Using ROLLBACK**
```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, grade) VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'C');
DELETE FROM Students WHERE student_id = 1;

ROLLBACK;
```
- No changes are saved; the database is restored to its previous state.

---

#### **Using SAVEPOINT**
```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE Students SET grade = 'A' WHERE student_id = 3;
SAVEPOINT sp1;

UPDATE Students SET grade = 'B' WHERE student_id = 4;

ROLLBACK TO sp1;
COMMIT;
```
- Changes to `student_id = 3` are saved, but changes to `student_id = 4` are undone.

### **Difference Between TCL and Other SQL Categories**

| **Feature**         | **TCL**                  | **DDL**                   | **DML**                   | **DCL**                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Manages transactions.   | Defines database schema.  | Manipulates data.         | Controls access.          |
| **Commands**        | `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `SET TRANSACTION` | `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER` | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`         |
| **Focus**           | Consistency and durability. | Structure of data.        | Data operations.          | Security and permissions. |
| **Effect on Data**  | Permanent or temporary. | Structural changes.        | Temporary until committed. | No direct data effect.    |

### **Conclusion**
TCL commands are essential for managing transactions in a database, ensuring consistency, reliability, and control over data modifications. They are especially useful in multi-user and distributed environments where transactional integrity is critical.
